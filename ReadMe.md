This repository contains the same module implemented twice. The first implementation (`Example-1`) is a straightforward implementation of a simple CRUD API for creating a blog posts in markdown and rendering them to HTML.

The second implementation (`Example-2`) uses the _Dependency Provider_ pattern and adds unit tests to confirm the behavior of the business logic.
